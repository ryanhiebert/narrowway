Jesus Wants His People to Share the Gospel.
===========================================

Story based on Acts 1:13 to 2:47
--------------------------------



After Jesus had ascended into heaven,
the disciples were lonely again.
It was very different from
the way it had been a few weeks before.
Now they had a message of hope to share with others.
Jesus had gone to prepare a place for His followers.
Someday, He would come again to take them to be with Him.

Jesus had told them to stay in Jerusalem
and wait for a special gift of power.
Afterward, they would be witnesses for Jesus
to people all around the world.
None of them knew how long they would have to wait.

As the days went by,
the disciples searched their lives to find
and eliminate anything that might hinder them
from being true witnesses for Jesus.
Wrongs were confessed and forgiven.
Hard feelings were put aside.
Love and concern for each other
became characteristic of relationships among them.
The circle of twelve disciples had been broken.
Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus,
and later committed suicide.
Praying for God to guide them,
the eleven remaining disciples selected Matthias
to join them as special eyewitnesses of the ministry of Jesus.

Soon came the time for the Feast of Weeks,
otherwise known as Pentecost.
Jews had come to Jerusalem from all parts of the world.
The disciples were still together in Jerusalem,
waiting for Jesus' promise to be fulfilled.
Each of them had chosen to put aside anything
that would interfere with God's love shining through them to others.
Eagerly, they waited for the time to begin spreading the good news of Jesus.

Suddenly, a sound like a strong wind filled the house.
What appeared to be tongues of fire came
and rested on each of them.
It was a sight and experience that none of them would ever forget.
They were filled with the Holy Spirit.
Leaving the place where they were gathered,
they began praising God and telling the story of Jesus
to anyone and everyone who would listen.

As the disciples told of Jesus,
they found they could speak in other languages.
People were there from Pertha, Media, Mesopotamia,
and many other parts of the world.
Visitors from far away were surprised
to hear the story of Jesus in their own native languages.
The Holy Spirit gave this gift
so that the good news could be heard and understood by all.

Peter and the other disciples preached with power.
They told of Jesus,
and showed how the scriptures identified Him as the Messiah.
With joy, they told how anyone who would accept Jesus
could be saved from sin and find a place in God's kingdom.
Best of all the good news they had to share
was the promise that someday Jesus would return
and take everyone who believed in Him to live with Him.
The Holy Spirit was there,
helping the listening people to understand the message
and realize that it was true.

Three thousand people accepted Jesus that day and were baptized.
As these new Christians returned to their homes,
they took the message of Jesus with them.
The message had begun to spread to people around the world.

What must it have been like to be one of the disciples at Pentecost?
They had a message of a crucified, resurrected, and returning Saviour.
It was a message of hope such as had never been given before.
Now they were commissioned to carry this wonderful news
to people all over the world.

We also have the privilege of sharing this good news.
To all who have heard of and accepted Him,
Jesus gives this commission.
He says, "Let your light shine before men."
Jesus' love should be seen in our words and actions.
We should never pretend to be the same
as others who do not know Jesus.
Jesus came to make a difference in our lives,
and He wants this difference to be noticed.

Witnessing for Jesus should not be a part
of our lives that is accidental.
Jesus has chosen us to be His witnesses.
We are the people He has selected
to share His good news with others.
This task is our duty and our privilege.

How are we to spread the gospel?
To the liberated demoniac by Lake Galilee,
Jesus gave simple directions.
He was to go home and tell his friends what God had done for him.
We can share Jesus in the same way.
As we experience for ourselves what it means to be saved by Jesus,
we will have something meaningful to share
with our friends and family.
A personal experience is a powerful testimony.

Sharing Jesus does not need to be elaborate or forced.
It is just telling others of the joy we have found in following Jesus.
We need to share freely with others
what Jesus has given so freely to us.
Everyone needs to have the opportunity
to meet Jesus and receive His salvation.

There are many different kinds of people in the world.
Some may not seem the type who would follow Jesus.
We do not need to make any such distinction.
Jesus does not want anyone excluded.
He told His disciples to begin by sharing the gospel at home.
Afterward, they were to move on to other places.
This was to continue until the good news of Jesus
would reach all the people of the world.

Jesus came to offer salvation to each person on earth.
There is not one who is excluded.
This is why it is so vital that all
be given the opportunity to accept Jesus.
Before He comes again,
the gospel will be preached in all the world.
Jesus wants us to work with Him to finish this task.

Thank you, Jesus, for the good news that You have brought us.
Thank you for choosing me to help share the gospel.
I want to be a faithful witness for You.
