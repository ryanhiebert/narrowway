Story based on Matthew 13:45, 46
--------------------------------

"Let's see, now. If I can find just one or two items of value in this box,
it will pay for itself."
Jack Anderson was looking through the contents of a
trunk he had just bought at an estate auction.
He had noticed a collection of knives in the box before he had bought it,
but never considered a purchase to have 'paid for itself'
unless he made a sizeable profit.

Jack owned a second-hand store, and sold all kinds of junk.
Now and then, there was actually something of value,
but most of his shelves held items of little value.
The local people knew that Jack's quality was low,
but so were the prices.

In the trunk, Jack found a set of clay bowls,
a coat, a few tools, as well as the knives.
Near the bottom of the trunk there was a small round stone.
This could be a good joke.
He would display it as a pearl and see if anyone
was stupid enough to believe it.

It was somewhat impressive, the way Jack fixed the stone up,
but nobody fell for the trick.
Nobody, that is, until one day . . .

"Say, have you heard the news?"
It was Martha, from the bakery down the road.
"Roy Kingston is looking for the world's finest pearl."

Roy Kingston was always looking for the best.
Nothing but the finest would do.
In fact, he had never been seen in a place like Anderson's Thrift Shop.

A plan began to form in Jack's mind.
What if he raised the price of it ridiculously high and advertised
it as something special?
Maybe he could trick Roy into coming
into the store to see the worthless stone.
Jack put together a fancy display, and raised the price on the 'pearl.'

A few days later, the shop door opened, and in walked Roy Kingston.

"I hear you have a valuable pearl," Mr. Kingston announced. "May I see it?"

Jack showed him the 'pearl.' "This is a high price on it," he explained,
"but you must understand, you will never see a finer pearl."
The more serious consideration the stone received, the better laugh for Jack.

Roy Kingston looked at the 'pearl' carefully.
He must have easily seen through the trick.
Then he spoke. "I will buy it.
I do not have enough money with me,
but give me a week and I will get it.
Can you hold it for me?"

Jack agreed, thinking that Mr. Kingston
would never actually be back for the purchase.
After one more week, he could discard the stone,
or keep it as a reminder of the big joke.
Imagine his surprise the next week as
Mr. Kingston returned with the money.
Roy Kingston had sold all his belongings,
and now he counted out the payment for the
'pearl' from Jack's second hand shop.

As Roy Kingston walked out of the shop with his purchase,
Jack could not help but wonder.
Was there actually something about that stone that was valuable?
Had he overlooked something?

Do you recognize the story? It is found in Matthew 13:45, 46.
Often I have heard this parable told,
and heard it explained how heaven
is a pearl that is of very great value.
Whatever we have to give up in order to win
heaven is worth it.
We find this message taught by Jesus in the verse before.
There we find the kingdom of heaven compared to a hidden treasure.
The man who found it went and GLADLY sold every possession he owned.
The treasure was so valuable that nothing else he had compared.
This message about the value of heaven is true, but the story of
the pearl was told to teach us something more.

Notice that the kingdom of heaven is compared, not to the pearl,
but to the merchant. Do you see what this means? Heaven is seeking for pearls.
Jesus is not the pearl being searched for, but the merchant doing the seeking.
If Jesus is the merchant, what could the pearl be? In Luke 19:10,
we have Jesus' own words that He came to seek and to save the lost.
This identifies the pearl as you and me. Have you ever thought of
yourself as 'the pearl of great price?' Jesus evidently did.

Now let us take a look at the rest of the story. The merchant
(Roy Kingston) found one that was priced very high.
In order to buy it, he sold everything he had.
Did you notice that the pearl was described as
"of great price," rather than "of great value."
The real value of the pearl was not shown by the high price tag,
but by the fact that the merchant was willing to pay such a price.

The message for you in this story is simple.
Jesus loves you more than you can understand.
In Luke 15, we find three stories that Jesus told.
There was a lost coin that was found, a lost sheep that was rescued,
and a lost son who was welcomed home.
Each story ends with great happiness and celebration.
Jesus wants us to understand how much we mean to Him
and how much happiness our salvation brings to heaven.

No man has any greater love than being willing to die for a friend.
[John 15:13] But Jesus' love goes beyond.
Jesus died to save you and me when we were in rebellion against Him.
While we were enemies, who would nail Him to a cross, Jesus died for us.
[Romans 5:10] How can it be? We can not explain how, but we can believe
that Jesus REALLY DOES love us. We can love Him in return,
and enjoy a personal relationship with Him.

Think about what an incredibly high price Jesus paid to you.
You are important! You are valuable! Think about the incredible
love that was necessary for Him to pay such a price,
even when you did not love Him in return.
Jesus loves you more than you can understand.
Don't you want to respond to His love,
and find out what a friendship with Him is like?

Thank You, Jesus, for loving me so much.
Thank You for telling the stories to help me
understand how much I mean to You.
Please help me remember how valuable
I am to You and how much You love me.
