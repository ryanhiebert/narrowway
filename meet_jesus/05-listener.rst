Story based on John 2:1-11.
---------------------------



Only a few months ago He had left
the carpenter shop and kissed her goodbye.
Mary remembered the angel telling her that
He was the Son of God and would save His people from their sins.
Still, it had been lonely since He left Nazareth.
Mary recalled with pleasure many happy times she had spent with Jesus.
He had always been a loyal son, a cheerful helper,
and an example of unselfish love.
How she wished everyone could know Him
and recognize Him as the promised Savior!

Now she had an exciting event to plan for.
There was soon to be a wedding over in Cana.
As a close relative, Mary had been asked to help with the preparations.
Jesus would be there along with His disciples.
How she looked forward to seeing Him again!

At last the day came.
Jesus was there, and Mary was fairly bursting
with pride and happiness to see Him again.
The feast was delicious and all the guests were having a good time.
Then somebody made a terrible discovery.
The wine had all been used.
What a predicament!
Lack of wine at the wedding feast suggested
a lack of hospitality and warned of a lack of happiness in the new home.

Going to Jesus, Mary told Him of the crisis.
"They have no wine," she said.
Maybe Jesus could use this opportunity to show His power
and let the people know that He was the Promised One.
How she longed for Him to be recognized and honored as the Son of God!
Jesus understood her wish and also the problem she told Him of.

"Mother," He said tenderly,
"how can I help you understand? My time has not yet come."
He did not need to mention the problem she had brought to Him.
Mary already knew that He would work to find a solution.
He cared and would do something.

To the waiting servants Mary said,
"You must do whatever He tells you."
She knew Jesus would not let her down.
Soon she would again see that her confident faith in Him was not in vain.

Close by were six large water pots.
"Fill them with water," Jesus instructed the servants.
Wondering how it could possibly do any good,
the servants did as they were told.
Soon the water pots were filled to the brim.

Next, Jesus said "Fill a cup and take it to the master of ceremonies."
The servants filled the cup, but something wonderful had happened.
The water looked different from when they poured it in,
just a few moments before.
Still wondering what had happened,
they took the cup to the master of ceremonies.

Unaware of the near crisis,
the master of ceremonies lifted the cup to his lips.
This was the best wine he had ever tasted!
Surprised, he called the groom and commented to him
how most people serve the best first.
It was unusual that the best had been saved until so late in the feast.
Most of the guests did not know about
the miracle Jesus had performed to save the feast.
Those who knew had seen that Jesus was someone very special.
It was not the time for Jesus to proclaim His mission,
but He had still answered His mother's request for help.

How much is a listening friend worth?
Often we may find ourselves talking to people
who really are not interested in what we say.
'How are you?' is a common expression of greeting.
One person asks the question and another repeats it.
Both go on their way feeling that the mini conversation was complete,
yet neither has answered the question.
It is as if each is saying,
"I do not have the time to tell you how I am,
and you probably do not care to know anyway."

Jesus was different.
He really did care for the happiness and well being of others.
He took time to listen to His mother's concerns.
When He listened to her, she knew that He cared and wanted to help.
The way Jesus listened to His mother let her know
that she did not need to ask Him to help.
All she did was tell Him that they were out of wine.
She knew He understood and would help.

As Jesus went about teaching,
people came to realize that He really cared about them.
Today He is still a caring and listening Friend for you and me.
He urges us to ask for what we need.
Jesus wants us to come to Him with all our needs,
and be confident that He will hear.

It would be a great honor to talk with
the U.S. President or another important world leader.
Consider then how much greater a privilege it is
to be invited to talk with the King of kings.
Jesus does not want us to shy away from talking to Him.
He taught us how we ought to address God when we pray to Him.
He wants us to come to Him with anything that concerns us.
God accepts us as His children
and wishes for us to address Him as our Father.
We should recognize His greatness and His goodness with praise.
Jesus wants us to tell Him of our needs and ask for His help.

Jesus wants us to be confident when we pray
that He will hear and answer our prayers.
By our own choices and actions
we may hinder God from answering our prayers.
In the Bible we are warned about them,
so that we might always be sure that our prayers are heard.
If we cling to sin in our lives,
or refuse to learn of God's will for us,
our prayers will be hindered.
By these things,
we tell God that we do not want Him in our lives,
and He allows us that freedom of choice.
In short, if we really accept Jesus as Lord of our lives,
we can be sure He hears and will answer our prayers.

Sometimes we are slow, maybe even reluctant to pray.
We wait until all other hope is gone before coming to God.
Whether our needs are big or small,
Jesus urges us to come to Him,
confident that He will answer.

Jesus has all the power we need
to overcome any obstacle in life.
He has a solution to every problem we will ever face.
Let us take advantage of this Friend who listens and cares.

Thank you, Jesus, for being a Friend who listens and cares.
Thank you for Your promises to help me.
I want to bring my cares to You.
