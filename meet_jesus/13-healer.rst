Story based on John 11:1-44.
----------------------------



Loud wailing filled the air as
Jesus and His disciples approached Bethany.
Four days earlier, Lazarus had died.
Many people were mourning for him.
Jesus had received a message that Lazarus was ill,
but had seemed in no particular hurry to come to him.
He had other plans.
First, He had told His disciples
that his sickness would not result in death.
Later, He had told them
He was going to awaken Lazarus from sleep.

When at last Jesus arrived in Bethany,
the situation was really quite hopeless.
Jesus could restore life to someone who had just died,
but with Lazarus, decay had already set in.
Friends and neighbors were there,
doing their best to comfort the grieving sisters of Lazarus.
When she heard of Jesus' arrival,
Martha left her visitors and went to Jesus.

"Lord," Martha said as she approached Jesus,
"if you had only been here,
You could have saved my brother from dying.
I know that God gives You whatever You ask of Him."

"Your brother will live again," were Jesus' words of comfort.

"I know he will awake again at the final resurrection," she replied.

"Martha," Jesus said, "I am the Resurrection and the Life."
Still Martha did not understand.

Martha then went and called Mary to come to Jesus.
As Mary came, she repeated the same sorrowful story as her sister.
If only Jesus had been there, Lazarus would not have died.

Tenderly, Jesus asked, "Where have you laid him?"
Mary and Martha led Jesus to the place where Lazarus lay.
Weeping, they approached the tomb.

"Roll away the stone!" Jesus command was a most unexpected one.

"Surely You cannot mean that!"
Martha was alarmed at the strange request.
"He has been dead four days already.
His body is decaying and smells awful."

"Do you not understand what I have told you?" Jesus asked.
If you will just believe, you will see the glory of God.

Despite serious misgivings,
some men rolled the stone away from the mouth of the cave.
The stench of decaying flesh was just as bad as they had imagined.
Wondering what Jesus would do next, they watched and waited.

Looking up to heaven, Jesus began talking to God aloud.
"Thank You, Father, for listening to My prayer," He said.
"I know that You always do.
Now I want all these people to know it too.
I want them to realize that You sent Me."

Then Jesus gave a loud shout.
"Lazarus! Come forth!"
The awful smell vanished and there was a movement inside the tomb.
Lazarus stood at the entrance of the tomb,
still wrapped in grave clothes.

Jesus turned to the awestruck people looking on.
"Help him get free of the grave clothes."

Amazement can hardly describe what was felt
by the people who had just witnessed this miracle.
Never before had they seen such a demonstration of the power of God.
Many who had come to mourn the death of Lazarus
returned to their homes believing in Jesus.

What a feeling of security!
Even death was no match for the power of Jesus.
When the sisters of Lazarus sent for Jesus,
they had told Him that Lazarus was sick.
They knew Jesus could heal the sick.
The power He showed by restoring life
to a dead man went beyond amazing.
No enemy could bring fear with a Friend such as Jesus there to help.

Even so, Jesus' healing power need not have surprised anyone
who listened to Him and believed His words.
He had declared that God sent His Son
so that people might have everlasting life.
The raising of Lazarus showed very clearly
that with Jesus there is no need to fear death.

Jesus offers more than just unending life.
Modern medicine can often preserve life for years.
Jesus offers more.
His plans for us include a full life of happiness and health.
It has always been in God's plan for us to be healthy.

Jesus told Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life."
Because Jesus was there, Lazarus would live again.
To believe in Jesus means that death
is no longer a lasting threat to us.
We need not fear sickness.
Jesus brings health.
We need not fear death.
Jesus has power to restore life.

How Jesus longed to enrich the lives of everyone!
Yet many people turned away from Him.
With sadness, Jesus saw people who thought
they were doing well refuse the blessings He had to give.
If only they could realize what they were missing.
Instead they pointed condemning fingers
at sinful people who came to Jesus.
They thought Jesus should turn away the very ones
He came to save--those who really needed Him.

Here is a lesson for us.
To receive Jesus' blessings,
we must admit our need for Him and accept Him.
There is no difference as far as who needs Jesus.
Every man, woman, and child needs Him.
What makes the difference is whether
we recognize our need and accept Him.
As we learn more about Jesus,
we will understand better how much we lack on our own.
We will also see what a great deal
we have to gain by accepting Jesus personally.

Jesus has already given many blessings
to make our lives happier, but there is more.
The love of Jesus is for every person.
When we experience Jesus' love,
we also have the privilege of sharing it with others.
Jesus gives to us freely.
He wants us to share with others in the same generous way.

Let us consider Jesus, and realize how much we need Him.
Let us accept Jesus' salvation
and experience the difference He makes.
Then, while we enjoy the blessings
of following Jesus for ourselves,
let us be generous in sharing His love with others.

Thank You for displaying Your power over sickness and death.
Thank You for conquering these enemies
so that I do not need to fear them.
Help me to trust in You and be free from fear.
