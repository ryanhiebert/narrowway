Story based on Matthew 14:22-33.
--------------------------------



What a day it had been!
All day long, Jesus had been teaching and healing
the people beside the shore of Lake Galilee.
Over five thousand people had been there, listening to His words.

Evening had come now,
and rather than sending the people away hungry,
Jesus asked his disciples to give the people a meal.
Nothing was on hand except a small lunch
that a little boy had brought with him.
Five little barley loaves and two fishes
seemed as good as nothing for so many.
Yet, when the boy gave his lunch to Jesus,
something wonderful happened.
Jesus blessed it, and from that little lunch,
everyone in the whole crowd had enough to eat.

Afterward, twelve baskets of leftovers were gathered.
Jesus then told the disciples to start across the lake,
while He dismissed the crowds to go home.
Jesus would often go into the mountains to be alone and pray.
As this night wore on,
Jesus was praying in the mountains
while the disciples were in the boat on their way across the lake.

About halfway across the lake,
sailing became a bit more difficult.
The wind began to blow and
the waves tossed the little boat about.
It was hardly a pleasure cruise,
but the fishermen on board assured the others
that they had come safely through worse storms than this before.

About four o'clock in the morning,
somebody raised a cry of alarm.
"Look over there! What is it? Is it a ghost?"
Sure enough, there was a figure
moving across the water toward them.
They had fought storms before
and had a fairly good idea about how to deal with them,
but not ghosts.
Old superstitious fears arose
that this might be an omen of coming doom.
Panic seized the disciples
as they saw the figure coming closer to the boat.

Then they heard a familiar voice.
It was Jesus!
"Cheer up! It's Me! Do not be afraid anymore."
There were sighs of relief from one end of the boat to the other.

Ready as always for adventure, Peter called out to Jesus.
"Lord, if it is really You,
please invite me to come meet You on the water."

Quickly the invitation came. "Come!"
To talk about such a thing was one matter,
but to actually walk on the water was something else.
Peter put one cautious foot out of the boat,
and then stepped out with the other.
There was Jesus, and he was walking on the water to meet Him.

This was great!
So thrilled was he with this wonderful new ability,
Peter nearly forgot the One he was going to meet.
The next thing he knew, a big wave splashed on him.
Peter began to notice the angry waves and he began to sink.

"Lord, save me!" he cried out
as he began to fight to keep from drowning.
Right away, Jesus was at his side
with an outstretched hand to lift him up.

"Peter, how little faith you have! Why did you doubt me?"
Together, Jesus and Peter walked back to the boat.
Stepping into the boat, they sat down.

With amazement and awe, the disciples exclaimed,
"Surely You are the Son of God!"

It seems the same story every year.
A new year begins with wonderful resolutions.
There are many virtues we resolve to display in the future.
Industry, self-control, thoughtfulness, neatness, and so on.
Just a short time later,
all the great intentions seem to have been of no value to us.
It is just too easy to slip back into the old bad habits.

It is easy to recognize the value of obeying Jesus.
To follow Jesus is to be a good citizen of the local community.
It also means hope for unending life.
Even so, our intentions to follow Jesus seem futile all too often.
If our determination is strong enough
for us to be somewhat successful in changing bad habits,
we are likely to become proud and arrogant.
We would cringe at the thought of the secrets of our lives being revealed.

Jesus knows us better than we know ourselves and He still loves us.
He knows that our best intentions are doomed to failure
unless we have a power more than we possess within ourselves.
He urges us to maintain a close connection with Him.
Our success is directly linked to our connection with Him.
Without Him we can do nothing, but with Him nothing is impossible.

Jesus made it possible for Peter to walk on the water.
He offers the power needed for living
a Christian life to all who will accept Him.
By connection with Jesus,
the impossibility of real obedience and unselfish love
becomes not only a possibility, but also a reality.

As the time drew near for Jesus to return to Heaven,
He promised to send the Holy Spirit
to be with His children continually.
The promised One would be a Helper, Comforter,
Teacher and Reminder of Jesus.
The promise of the Holy Spirit is ours
to give us success as we choose to follow Jesus.

When He told His disciples to spread the gospel,
Jesus did not leave them to accomplish the task by their own efforts.
The power of the Holy Spirit was promised
to make their witness really effective.
By the power of the Holy Spirit is how
the gospel will spread to people in all parts of the world.

Jesus gave many promises to help us follow Him faithfully.
He promises wisdom, forgiveness for our sins, and unlimited potential.
Promises have been given to us, designed to meet every need.
Through Jesus, we can claim the fulfillment of every promise in the Bible.

Jesus understands our limitations and our weaknesses.
He can supply all that we lack,
and promises to do so if we just ask.
Why struggle and fail,
when by depending on Jesus we can be sure of success?
Let us recognize our need and receive the help Jesus wants to give us.

Thank You, Jesus, for the promises You have given to help me.
Thank You that I can count on You always to keep them.
I will look to You for the power I need.
