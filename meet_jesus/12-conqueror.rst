Story based on Acts 1:1-12
--------------------------



That Sabbath was the unhappiest the disciples could remember.
For some time they had been following Jesus
as He went about preaching.
Repeatedly they had seen evidence that Jesus was the Messiah.
Often, Jesus had told them He must suffer and die,
yet they never thought He meant it literally.
Surely, they had thought, it must have some symbolic meaning.
Then came the betrayal and arrest in the garden of Gethsemane.
Jesus went through a mockery of a trial and then was crucified.
Now He had been in the tomb for a whole day.
All their hopes built on Jesus seemed to have been for nothing.

Early the next morning,
when a few women went to the tomb to finish embalming Jesus' body,
they found the tomb empty and the stone rolled away.
Angels were there declaring that Jesus had risen from the dead.
It seemed too good to be true.

By the end of the day,
all of the disciples except Thomas had seen Jesus alive again.
One week later,
Thomas also saw Jesus and joined the others
who could personally testify that Jesus was alive again.
Without a doubt, Jesus was the Messiah & the Son of God.

For forty days after His resurrection
Jesus spent time with His disciples,
trying to help them understand the nature of His kingdom.
What had seemed like a tragic defeat
was really the most glorious victory.
Jesus had won the battle against Satan.
Soon He would return to heaven,
but He would not leave His faithful followers alone.
The Holy Spirit was promised to comfort and strengthen them.
Jesus would be gone for a while
to prepare a place for all who believe in Him.
Then they could live with Him forever.
The kingdom would be far better
than the fondest hopes of any of the disciples.

The time was near for Jesus to return to Heaven.
He began to tell His disciples what they were to do after He had gone.
They still did not understand.
"Will you restore the kingdom to Israel now?" they wanted to know.

"You must wait and see," Jesus told them.
"Meanwhile, I want you to tell others about Me.
Help others get ready to be part of My kingdom."

As Jesus was speaking, He began to rise into the air.
Higher and higher He went,
until the disciples could barely see Him.
Finally a cloud hid Him from their sight,
but still the disciples continued
to gaze into the sky hoping for one last glimpse of Jesus.

"Men of Galilee," spoke a voice nearby.
As the disciples turned,
they saw two strangers who were dressed in white.
"Why do you keep staring into the sky?
You just saw Jesus taken up into Heaven.
He will come again, in the same way you watched Him leave."

Perhaps these were the same angels
who were at the tomb to announce Jesus' resurrection.
Now they had been sent by Jesus to give the disciples hope.
They would see Jesus again.
Just as they saw Him leave to return to Heaven,
He would come again.
This promise would be the hope
of Christians until the end of time.
Jesus will return to take His people to live with Him forever.

What a treasure of memories Jesus left
with His disciples as He ascended!
All the experiences they had shared by Lake Galilee.
The joy of people to whom Jesus had restored health.
His parables came back to their minds whenever
they saw a shepherd with his flock,
a grape vine, or a farmer sowing his fields.

The life of Jesus had been cut short
by the hatred of jealous men,
but it had not been a failure.
Satan had brought sin and suffering upon humanity.
Jesus was the only One who could help.
He had come to earth to destroy the works of the devil.
By His death on the cross, He had accomplished just that.

Often it seemed that Satan must be winning the struggle.
People who had power and influence worked to destroy Him.
Jesus trusted the leading of His Father
and looked beyond the discouragement all around Him.
He refused to give up, and as He faced death on the cross,
He could declare victory.

Jesus really did overcome.
Satan claimed that God was unjust and impossible to obey.
When Jesus died on the cross like a criminal,
it seemed that He was defeated.
Yet by His death, He finished a life of perfect obedience.
Not only did He prove that Satan's charges were false,
but He paid the necessary price to offer forgiveness
to all who would accept Him.
When we choose to accept Jesus,
we receive forgiveness and find peace with God.
Satan wants to destroy us,
but we may defeat him by relying on Jesus.

Sometimes we fail to live as a Christian should.
Our weakness threatens to make Jesus' sacrifice
of no benefit for us.
Jesus never gives up on us.
When we fail, we need to turn again to Jesus in repentance,
knowing He will forgive. He began a good work in us.
We can depend on Him to see the task through to completion.
What we need to do is continue to choose to follow Jesus.

Most precious to Christians of every age
is Jesus' promise to come again.
He will come again to take us to be with Him.
We need this hope for the future to help us cope with today.
It is easy to become discouraged with life
as we see economic crisis,
war and suffering all around.
Jesus gave these words to cheer us now.
"Behold, I am coming quickly."

Thank you, Jesus, for defeating Satan for me.
Thank you for Your promise to come again for me.
I accept You and plan to live with You forever when You come.
